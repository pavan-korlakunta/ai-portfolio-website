## Profile Image Setup

To complete the profile image integration:

1. Save your profile image as `profile-image.jpg` in this `assets/` folder
2. The image should be in JPG format for optimal web performance
3. Recommended dimensions: 400x400 pixels (square format)
4. The website will automatically use this image for:
   - Header navigation logo
   - Profile upload section
   - GitHub profile display
   - LinkedIn profile display
   - LinkedIn post avatars

## Current Image References

All image references have been updated to use `assets/profile-image.jpg` with fallback placeholders in case the image is not found.
